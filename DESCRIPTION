Description: ARGOS (Automatic Regression for Governing Equations) provides a comprehensive set of tools 
    for performing system identification of both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems directly from data. 
    ARGOS simplifies the complex task of constructing mathematical models of dynamical systems from 
    observed input and output data, supporting various types of systems, including those described by ordinary 
    differential equations. It employs optimal numerical derivatives for enhanced accuracy and employs formal 
    variable selection techniques to help identify the most relevant variables, thereby enabling the development 
    of predictive models for system behavior analysis. Our package requires `Python` to be installed in order to use `reticulate`.
