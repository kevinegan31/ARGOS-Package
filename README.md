# Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS)

This Github repository contains codes for the paper _Automatically identifying dynamical systems from data_.

## Motivation

The purpose of this repository is to enable users to perform system identification of linear and nonlinear systems automatically.
System identification refers to the process of building mathematical models of dynamical systems using measurements of the input and output signals.
Dynamical systems can either be discrete or continuous and use ordinary or partial differential equations to describe their time-varying behavior.
The Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS) algorithm combines optimal numerical derivatives with formal variable selection procedures for automatic discovery of dynamical systems from data.
Upon identification, users can apply the resulting models to generalize and predict the systems existing in their data.
